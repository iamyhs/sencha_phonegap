 * 
 * 10)Geolocation
 * 		The geolocation object provides access to the device's GPS sensor.
 * 
 * Geolocation provides location information for the device, such as latitude and longitude. 
 * Common sources of location information include Global Positioning System (GPS) 
 * and location inferred from network signals such as IP address, RFID, WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, 
 * and GSM/CDMA cell IDs. No guarantee is given that the API returns the device's actual location.
 * 
 * This API is based on the W3C Geo location API Specification. 
 * Some devices already provide an implementation of this spec. 
 * For those devices, the built-in support is used instead of replacing it with PhoneGap's implementation. 
 * For devices that don't have geolocation support, 
 * PhoneGap's implementation should be compatible with the W3C specification.
 * 
 * 
 * Methods
 * 		geolocation.getCurrentPosition
 * 		geolocation.watchPosition
 * 		geolocation.clearWatch
 * 
 * Arguments
 * 		geolocationSuccess
 * 		geolocationError
 * 		geolocationOptions
 * 
 * Objects (Read-Only)
 * 		Position
 * 		PositionError
 * 		Coordinates
 * 
 * 
 * 11)Media
 * 		The Media object provides the ability to record and play back audio files on a device.
 * 
 * 		var media = new Media(src, mediaSuccess, [mediaError], [mediaStatus]);
 * 
 * Note: The current implementation does not adhere to a W3C specification for media capture, 
 * and is provided for convenience only. 
 * A future implementation will adhere to the latest W3C specification and may deprecate the current APIs.
 * 
 * 
 * Parameters
 * 		src: A URI containing the audio content. (DOMString)
 * 		mediaSuccess: (Optional) The callback that is invoked after a Media object has completed 
 * 						the current play/record or stop action. (Function)
 * 		mediaError: (Optional) The callback that is invoked if there was an error. (Function)
 * 		mediaStatus: (Optional) The callback that is invoked to indicate status changes. (Function)
 * 
 * Methods
 * 		media.getCurrentPosition: Returns the current position within an audio file.
 * 		media.getDuration: Returns the duration of an audio file.
 * 		media.play: Start or resume playing audio file.
 * 		media.pause: Pause playing audio file.
 * 		media.release: Releases the underlying OS'es audio resources.
 * 		media.seekTo: Moves the position within the audio file.
 * 		media.startRecord: Start recording audio file.
 * 		media.stopRecord: Stop recording audio file.
 * 		media.stop: Stop playing audio file.
 * 
 * Additional ReadOnly Parameters
 * 		_position: The position within the audio playback in seconds. 
 * 					Not automatically updated during play, call getCurrentPosition to update.
 * 		_duration: The duration of the media in seconds.
 * 
 * Supported Platforms
 * 		Android
 * 		iOS
 * 		Windows Phone 7 ( Mango )
 * 
 * 
 * 12)Notification
 * 		Visual, audible, and tactile device notifications.
 * 
 * Methods
 * 		notification.alert
 * 		notification.confirm
 * 		notification.beep
 * 		notification.vibrate
 * 
 * 
 * 13)Storage
 * 		Provides access to the devices storage options.
 * 
 * 		This API is based on the W3C Web SQL Database Specification and W3C Web Storage API Specification. 
 * 		Some devices already provide an implementation of this spec. 
 * 		For those devices, the built-in support is used instead of replacing it with PhoneGap's implementation. 
 * 		For devices that don't have storage support, 
 * 		PhoneGap's implementation should be compatible with the W3C specification.
 * 
 * Methods
 * 		openDatabase
 *

 * 		name
 * 		version
 * 		display_name
 * 		size
